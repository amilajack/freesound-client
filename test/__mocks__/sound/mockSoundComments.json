You might also try taking the SS portion of the clip and reducing the gain by 3-4dB.  I also noticed a couple of pops in the \"i\" sound of \"ing.\" did you stretch the audio at all?  It almost sounds like an artifact from either a quick copy/paste to cover a bad spot, or a time-stretch byproduct. ",
